The basic idea for this presentation was to answer the questions like:
1. What is Machine learning?
2. What algorithms are used in MAchine Learning.
3. Choose one algorithm and Explain. In our case it was Random Forest algorithm.
4. Examples on how the algorithm is used to analyse data and train machine.
